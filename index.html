            <p>This is my last night in Chile. I want to stare at the wall and think about what the last two months have been like, but I have three assignments due, it's busy season at work, and I have an interview to think about. 
               The Peak End Rule says that you remember the peak moment of a memory - and the end. Is my first big trip out of the country going to be stained with memories of being stuck in a small room working? Maybe. I'm not complaining - I am just wondering how I can approach work and school
               in the next 22 hours before I leave so that I have a positive 'end' of my trip. Let's combine trip reflection and this assignment.

               My first week in Santiago was hot and too busy. I went to a Spanish language school 4 hours 
               every morning and worked a full day after. My Spanish was honestly not bad. I loved walking all around the city, even if my face was bright red all the time from the heat. 
               I didn't go to the school the second week, and just worked. This week was even better. Sometimes I would have a smile on my face for no reason because I was just happy to be here.

               Now, I'm in Buenos Aires. I did the same thing as Santiago - spend one week at a school while working and then the next just working. 
               Santiago has the hills and the Andes, but Buenos Aires feels lighter. The weather is 10 degrees cooler and I still love walking everywhere. 
               Argentina is known for it's bbq and it's good...but can't replace Kansas City's. There actually *is* a bbq restaurant here called Kansas, but I didn't have time to go.

               I took a week off to go to Patagonia. I climbed a glacier and descended into an ice cave and it's one of the best things I've ever done. I saw King Penguins and sea lions. I also didn't look at my computer for several days and I feel like
               I'm still catching up a month later.

            <h3>4/16/2023</h3>
            <p>
               Back in Santiago and I worked for the week without doing much else. I stayed by Cerro Santa Lucia, thinking I would walk there during the day, but barely left my airbnb. I don't really remember this week well but I think there isn't anything
               to remember except the taste of empanadas from across the street, stress, and work. I did get a terre moto with a friend and that was a great night. 
               This week when I could barely make time to get a drink with a friend, I wondered how I would be feeling working like this in Kansas City. Would I feel worse, being at home and experiencing
               nothing new? Did it make it better to be in Santiago, someplace new, even though I was still effectively only working?

            <h3>Sometime After 4/16/2023</h3>
            <p> I don't have much to say about this time frame, because I went to San Pedro de Atacama but didn't get to do anything because I had to work and lost track of time.

            <p> I went to Bolivia with 4 other people from Brazil. This was the highlight of my trip. Going to Perito Moreno glacier down South was the best day, but this was the overall 
               best area. I saw lagoons, flamingos, vicuna, mountains, desert, cacti, salt flats, cliffs, and geysers. In the span of three days, I saw so many landscapes
               that it was like driving from one movie set to another. I saw a desert <em>mirage</em>.

            <p> I'm back in Santiago and I'm finally ready to come home. I can't wait to come home. 
               I'm excited to see my grandmother, my friends, eat home cooked food, &amp; water my plants.
